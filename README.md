# Python Scripts for Data Analysis

This repository contains two Python scripts designed for data analysis tasks:

1. **PyBank**: Analyzes financial data to calculate metrics such as total months, net total amount of profits/losses, average change, and identifies the greatest increases and decreases in profits over a period.

2. **PyPoll**: Analyzes election data to determine election statistics including the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and identifies the winner based on popular vote.
